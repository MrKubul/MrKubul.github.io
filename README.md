# my-webpage

My first frontend project. It will be webpage portfolio for all of my work related to coding. i will use it as homepage in case of hosting other projects online.
The goal is to create everything using pure JS, HTML and CSS. Webpage has to be smooth, scale to mobile devices has animations and be responsive. In some time i wiil maybe rewrite it to framework of my choice.
